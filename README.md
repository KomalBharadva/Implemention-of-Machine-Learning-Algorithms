Detection of fraudulent transactions, House price prediction, Covid-19 cases prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms.

Now-a-days the prices of houses are skyrocketing in almost every country. In this research, we will predict the house sales price for King County in US. We have applied Multiple Linear Regression model and Random Forest to this dataset which gave us good results. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease which could spread by touching contaminated surfaces or being in close contact of someone having this disease. In this investigation we will predict the number of cases for different countries worldwide. We have used Decision Tree and Time Series Forecasting for further analysis. In this fast-growing digital world, fraud detection has become very important especially to financial institutions and banks. This research aims to use Logistic Regression and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) as machine learning algorithms to predict the Fraud. The main goal of this research is to derive some interesting insights and findings from chosen datasets which also includes analysis of various machine learning methodologies.
